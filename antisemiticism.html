<p>ABC’s report the five Israeli men who were arrested and detained on 9/11 for alegedly smiling while taking photos of the bombed Twin Towers at the World Trade Center presents the possiblity that these men were acting in a way that was detrimental to US security. The style of the reporting creates a tone of doubt that puts fuel into a fire of suspicion that was especially rampant during this time. 
</p>
<p>Accordingly, readers who play into an anti-Israeli, anti-semetic bias, used stories like this to justify their anti-Isreali sentiment surrounding the events of September 11th. Critical readers however can identify holes in this interpretation such as multiple unnamed sources, the unrelated mentioning of Moussid, Israeli intelligence, and the unjustified implementation of forty days of solitary confinement. 
</p>
<p>The indisputable facts are: there were five Isreali men taking photos of the World Trade Center post attack, these men are Israeli citizens, they rented a moving truck, they had forgien passports and cash on them, they overstayed their tourist visas, they detained in the United States for more than two months, the men were deported back to Israel. The truth becomes blurry once the men are detained. ABC believes that at least some of the men were Moussid agents, sourcing The Forward, “the respected Jewish newspaper” even though they have confirmation from the Israeli Embassy stating, “These five men were not involved in any intelligence operation in the United States,and the American intelligence authorities have never raised this issue with us," "The story is simply false." 
</p>
<p>ABC legitimizing this story benefits governmental agencies such as the FBI or CIA in that these occurrences justify their existence. Interestingly ABC shares an apparent conflict of interest in this story when they quote their employee, Vince Cannistraro, who is a “former chief of operations for counterterrorism with the CIA who is now a consultant for ABCNEWS.” The other people who would benefit from this story being legitimized, are those already pushing anti-semtic propaganda surrounding the attacks on 9/11.
</p>
<p>The framing of this story puts forth the suggestion that the Israeli men were members of Mossad, and possibly had an affiliation with 9/11, only to offer evidence later in the story that refutes it, as an apparent attempt to suggest an unbiased narrative. Presenting the idea that these men played a role in 9/11 in readers’ heads at the beginning of the story makes it challenging for a non-critical reader to then break away from this idea, especially in the climate of fear that was rampant when the US was under attack in 2011.
</p>
<p>This kind of false affiliation between actors and acts of terrorism stirs resentment and endangers Jewish people, both from the US and from abroad. This particular story links to a thread of anti-semetic propaganda spread during the attack and in the aftermath leading up to today. The use of falsehoods, such as the idea that no Jewish people were killed during the attacks, creates a climate of hatred and anti-Jewish sentiment in the US.
