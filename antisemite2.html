<h1>9/11 and Israeli Spies</h1>
<p>After 9/11, America was left with the task of understanding why various conspiracy theories arose, and several are contemporary today. Conspiracy theories ranged from 9/11 being an inside job to there being no planes at all. A conspiracy theory formed that the state of Israel was somehow involved in the attacks. The media has not helped in derailing these conspiracy theories but has amplified them quickly finding like-minded people and forming groups of 9/11 conspiracy theorists.</p> 
<h1>Conspiracy Theories</h1>
<p>Anti-Semitic 9/11 conspiracy theories stemmed from a particular event while the twin towers were falling. The ABCs News article “Were Israelis Detained on Sept. 11 Spies?” covered a story from a woman named Maria, who does not disclose her last name and claims to have seen Israeli men dancing and filming the twin towers falling. The belief from that point on was that the men were part of Mossad, the Israeli Intelligence Agency and that somehow they were involved. One different interpretation of the story comes from the attorney representing the men. The attorney representing the men claims there is no malice or nefarious meaning behind the men's behavior. However, with this information came theorists, as well as an FBI investigation regarding the men. The FBI did not find any connection between the five men and the attacks on 9/11. The report of ABC news delivers the information while writing to attempt an unbiased narrative.</p> 
<h1>Odd Behavior</h1>
<p>The puzzling behavior may have a mundane explanation. However, other interpretations may jump to the men involved with Israeli intelligence thus explaining the odd behavior. The speculation of the story is false however the arrests made are true. Another true aspect that raised suspicion of the men was how quickly their employer Dominik Suter fled the US back to Israel after the men had been arrested. When the men were arrested they were found with a camera, cash, and multiple passports. The arrest started conspiracy theorists discovering decade-old allegations to ‘prove’ involvement of Israeli Intelligence. In an article published by <em>The Herald</em>, there is mention of Israeli prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu was asked about the 9/11 attacks and was quoted saying “it's very good. And then corrected himself saying ‘Well, it’s not good, but it will generate immediate sympathy for Isreal from Americans.” With that, it still appears Israel had no prior knowledge of the attack.</p>
<h1>Fake News</h1>
<p>The fake news represented in the story is not entirely fake but is based on hearsay which is difficult to disprove. <em>The New York Times</em> also covers the topic of why there would be suspicions concerning these men. The Anti-Defamation League (ADL) explains bigotry behind the 9/11 conspiracy theories continues to thrive. The theory is harmful, and some say the claim made by a woman named Maria was false. The ADL claims the arrest of the five Israeli men dancing never happened. Various of the story have circulated in the media since 2001 from Jewish-controlled media, and foreknowledge of the anti-semitic rhetoric seeps through the media, //just google ‘dancing Israelis’// and find out for yourself. Who might believe the story well members of the FBI still held suspicions about the men being involved in 9/11, which benefits 9/11 conspiracy theorists, American right-wing extremists, and white supremacists who claim that Israel, not Osama bin Laden, was behind the horrible events of 9/11? Believers on the Left may believe 9/11 was a ploy for the Bush-Cheney administration to expand military and imperialism efforts as a way to subdue vehement concerns about victims of the war with thoughts of a Jewish conspiracy. Other theories arose, such as The Guardian article, “The Hate Will Not Die” addressing that millions of people believe 4,000 Jews stayed home on 9/11 was proven to not be true. And <em>Clevland Jewish News</em> claims 3,000 Jews died instantly on 9/11.</p> 
<h1>The Harm</h1>
<p>Where does the fear of Jewish domination come from? The ADL believes it is xenophobic behavior is a fear of Anti-Semitic coupled with conspiracy theorists of all-powerful Jews stemming from <em>The Protocol of the Elders of Zion</em>. Is a fabricated text supposedly made by the Jews to achieve world domination? There is no factual evidence the men had foreknowledge of the events of 9/11 and seemed to just be common scam artists working for a moving company Urban Moving Systems. The harmful rhetoric is contemporary in modern culture today, and as recently as 2019 where a rock at the University of Tennessee was vandalized with spray paint reading “Jews did 9/11”.  //Google: “Dancing Israel.”//, unfortunately, false and hateful rhetoric is prominent in current culture.</p>
