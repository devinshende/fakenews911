<p>It is well known that the two main buildings to collapse during the tragic 9/11 event were World Trade Centers 1 and 2, but how did this affect the other buildings, especially World Trade Center 7 (WTC 7)? </p>

<p>There are many different stories from the public, but the greatest skeptics of this event are the Architects and Engineers of 9/11 (AE911). They are an organization of architects, scientists, and engineers that have come together to prove the government investigation and reports from the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST).</p> 

<p>The original report from NIST claims that the collapse of WTC 7 was caused by different things that caused a somewhat domino effect; they call it a progressive collapse. The first thing that started this was the collapse of WTC 1. The debris that fell from that building onto WTC 7 caused fires and some structural damage to the building. The fires then caused thermal movements and the expansion and contraction of the structural beams and columns. These then caused a critical support column, column 79, to buckle and begin an upward collapse.</p> 

<p>Something else that contributed greatly to the collapse of WTC 7 was the fact that sprinklers on the floors with fires either “failed” or were not present. Although, it is important to note that these sprinklers failed due to damage to water supply lines caused by the collapse of WTC 1. Had it not been for the lack of water, WTC 7 could still be standing today, according to the NIST report, because the structural damage done by debris was not sufficient enough to cause a total collapse.</p> 

<p>Despite this, the AE911 organization contests this report with their belief that the collapse of WTC 7 was a controlled demolition. Their main argument is that the building’s collapse was in free-fall and straight down, similarly to a pancake, something that shouldn’t have been able to happen if it happened due to the reasons the NIST report states.</p>

<p>They support their claims by explaining that the fire was too hot considering what was there and what caused them; the only things in the building were ordinary office supplies, nothing that could’ve caused the fire to be over 1400 degrees Celcius. Therefore, it could not have caused the structural columns to fail. The group concludes their statements with their belief that the design of the structure was not the cause of the collapse, something that the NIST says was at fault.</p> 

<p>While there is some truth to what the AE911 organization has to say about this event, there are other parts that have been debunked by the NIST. For example, the “free-fall” and “pancake-like” collapse of the building was due to the angle of the videos of the collapse, mostly taken from the north face of the building. In addition to this, the exterior structure of the building was stiffer and stronger than the internal structure, causing it to seem like a symmetrical collapse. Another thing to take into consideration is that some videos do not show the different stages of collapse, leading skeptics to believe that the collapse only lasted 2.25-2.5 seconds, when in reality it was 5.4 seconds.</p>

<p>With the different conspiracies, it’s tricky for readers to distinguish between truth and falsehood, especially with how reliable and concise AE911 frames itself and its articles. They challenge the government with these theories, effectively finding someone to place the blame on. It discredits the government and the people that are supposed to be trustworthy, further damaging their reputation with the general public.</p>
