<p>In October of 2001, a series of letters were mailed to various media elites and politicians, containing a deadly strain of the disease anthrax, causing the recipients of the letters to die or get infected from the inhalation of the spores.
</p>
<p>In the years since, a massive investigation was undertaken, requiring collaboration of scientists and professionals across 6 continents to help determine the details and find the person responsible for the attacks. The investigation was among the largest ever undertaken by the FBI, including more than <a class="link" href="https://archives.fbi.gov/archives/about-us/history/famous-cases/anthrax-amerithrax/amerithrax-fact-sheet">9100 interviews and 61 searches. </a>
</p>
<p>In a press conference from the FBI on August 6th, 2008, the FBI reveals previously confidential evidence to the public in a press conference. In the conference, they reveal quite compelling evidence to suspect a certain Dr Bruce Ivins, who had died of a tylenol overdose just eight days prior to the press conference. 
</p>
<p>As US Attourney Jeff Taylor describes, Dr. Ivins was a professional who was very knowledgeable in the field of biology and was suffering mental health problems and professional setbacks in his work to create a vaccine for anthrax. Ivins was the sole individual in his lab who had the expertise and access to equipment such as a lyophilizer required to produce and dry the spores as well as send it off in the envelopes to congress and the press, whom he had communicated with extensively in years prior to the attack. Ivins was working alone, and took a suspicious amount of extra time to himself in the days before the attack, which was unprecedented for him in previous time at his job. The strain of anthrax was identified by scientists as coming from a parent strain in 2005 that was created and solely maintained by Dr Ivins in his lab. All this and more suspicious evidence was used to solve the mystery of who was responsible for the worst act of bioterrorism in US history.
</p>

<p>The series of mailings occurred beginning October and over the next two months, 4 people would die and 17 others would become infected with anthrax. This happened very quickly after the nation was already in a panic about 9/11, and accelerated panic. </p>

<p>How many people died or were infected? CNN says 5 killed and over 2 dozen infected in one office alone, while the History channel reduces the count to 4 dead and 17 infected. FBI 
Press release says 5 killed and 17 infected. It is unclear as to the correct count or what the motives would be for leaving some people out of the count. 
</p>

<p>Since the attack, there was claims that clashed with the FBI’s conclusion as late as 2014. In 2011, the NYTimes refuted the FBI’s conclusion, and claimed that there was not enough proof that Dr Bruce Ivins was working alone. They questioned some of the methodology used to come to the conclusions the FBI conducted, not necessarily saying that the conclusion was wrong, but that the practices were not up to standards. Later in 2014, the Government Accountability Office aligned with these sentiments, releasing a <a class="link" href="https://www.gao.gov/products/gao-15-80">77 page report</a> which found that the FBI lacked a comprehensive approach to the report. </p>

<p>Along with the Times, the <a class="link" href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424052748704541004575011421223515284">Wall Street Journal cast doubt on the FBI’s explanation</a>. They describe that there was a major piece overlooked in the investigation: silicon. Apparently the anthrax found in the envelopes was found to contain a very high concentration of silicon (1.4%), which is exceedingly high for it to be accidental. In the FBI’s own investigation, scientists at livermore attempted to create anthrax spores with accidental silicon and found much lower concentrations, which suggests that the silicon would have had to be placed maliciously on purpose, something that WSJ claims Ivins was unable to do in his lab. They conclude this to insinuate that a third party acted in collaboration with Ivins to weaponize spores with silicon or that the FBI conclusion was wrong or incomplete.
</p>
<p>Fake news sites were happy to adopt this story to cast doubt on the federal government’s supposed clean and simple explanation of Ivins’ mental health issues and working alone to cause the attacks. One such website, <a class="link" href="https://911truth.org/the-anthrax-attacks-remain-unsolved/">911Truth.org</a> reposted the WSJ article and adds that no autopsy was performed, and that there was no suicide note for Ivins’ death, saying the mystery is still unsolved 7 years later.
</p>
<p>The anthrax attacks of 2001 furthered national panic amidst the political climate post 911. They added to fears that America was under attack and showed the world how unprepared even the United States was for threats of bioterrorism. It was the most successful instance of bioterrorism in American history and stumped the scientific community and FBI for years as to how or who accomplished the horrific feat. Years after, they found their conclusion, but that did not seem to fully satisfy conspiracy theorists and other skeptics.
