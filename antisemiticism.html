<p>ABC’s 2002 report of the five Israeli men who were arrested and detained on 9/11 for allegedly smiling while taking photos of the bombed Twin Towers at the World Trade Center presents the possibility that these men were acting in a way that was detrimental to US security. The reporting style creates a tone of doubt that fuels a fire of suspicion that was especially rampant during this time.</p>
<p>Accordingly, readers who play into an anti-Israeli, anti-Semitic bias, used stories like this to justify their anti-Israeli sentiment surrounding the events of September 11th. Critical readers, however, can identify holes in this interpretation, such as multiple unnamed sources, the unrelated mentioning of Mossad, Israeli intelligence, and the unjustified implementation of forty days of solitary confinement. The belief that Mossad was part of 9/11 doesn’t end with these five men. According to the ADL, a thread of conspiracy surrounds Mossad being privy to or causing the 9/11 bombings. The ADL also reports that along with a Mossad-related conspiracy, there is a thread of belief that Jewish Ownership of the World Trade Centers was the reason for the attack, and this focuses on what they would gain from their building’s destruction.</p> 
<p>The indisputable facts are: there were five Israeli men taking photos of the World Trade Center post-attack, these men are Israeli citizens, they rented a moving truck, they had foreign passports and cash on them, they overstayed their tourist visas, they were detained in the United States for more than two months, the men were deported back to Israel. The truth becomes blurry once the men are detained. ABC believes that at least some of the men were Mossad agents, sourcing The Forward, “the respected Jewish newspaper” even though they have confirmation from the Israeli Embassy stating, “These five men were not involved in any intelligence operation in the United States, and the American intelligence authorities have never raised this issue with us," "The story is simply false." ABC legitimizing this story benefits governmental agencies such as the FBI or CIA in that these occurrences justify their existence.</p> 
<p>Interestingly, ABC shares an apparent conflict of interest in this story when they quote their employee, Vince Cannistraro, a “former chief of operations for counterterrorism with the CIA who is now a consultant for ABCNEWS.” The other people who would benefit from this story’s validation, are those already pushing anti-Semitic propaganda surrounding the attacks on 9/11. More propaganda pushed after 9/11 with anti-Semitic messaging is the message that no Jewish people were killed at the World Trade Center. According to the BBC, of the 2,071 victims of 9/11, 119 of them were confirmed as Jewish.</p>  
<p>The framing of this story suggests that the Israeli men were members of Mossad, and possibly had an affiliation with 9/11, only to offer evidence later in the story that refutes it as an apparent attempt to suggest an unbiased narrative. Presenting the idea that these men played a role in 9/11 at the beginning of the story makes it challenging for a non-critical reader to then break away from this idea, especially in the climate of fear that was rampant when the US was under attack in 2011. This kind of false affiliation between actors and acts of terrorism stirs resentment and endangers Jewish people, both from the US and abroad.</p> 
<p>This story links to a thread of anti-Semitic propaganda spread during the attack and in the aftermath leading up to today. The use of falsehoods, such as the idea that no Jewish people were killed during the attacks, and unjustified correlations between Israelis and the bombing creates a climate of hatred and anti-Jewish sentiment in the US.</p>
