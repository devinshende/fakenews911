	Gary Hart’s article with the Denver Post: <em>We were warned of an attack on the scale of 9/11. No one listened</em>, blatantly points out a conspiracy theory on the 9/11 attacks with the claim that the US government knew that a major terrorist attack would result in mass amount of deaths yet did nothing in anticipation of protecting against an attack. This claim has become popularized by conspiracy theorists with the term LIHOP, which stands for “let it happen on purpose”. This notion is summarized by the idea that multiple politicians and officials with higher government power would have prior knowledge of the 9/11 attacks yet would ignore it or weaken the defense of the United States to allow the hijacked planes to not be intercepted. 
	</p>
	<p>
	Hart cites how the government would reference fighting against terrorism months before 9/11 as evidence that the government knew about the attacks. Hart frames his article in a way that only presents the possibility of the government having knowledge beforehand by presenting quotes from the US government about terrorism that dates before 9/11. These include referencing a US interim report from April 15, 2000 which states, <a class="link" href="https://www.denverpost.com/2021/09/10/20-years-9-11-why-werent-we-warned-gary-hart/">“The U.S. survival interests include America’s safety from direct attack … by either states or terrorists”</a> and a comission report from the government on January 1, 2001 which states <a class="link" href="https://www.denverpost.com/2021/09/10/20-years-9-11-why-werent-we-warned-gary-hart/">“...weapons proliferation with the persistence of international terrorism will end the relative invulnerability of the U.S. homeland to catastrophic attack. A direct attack against American citizens on American soil is likely over the next quarter century”.</a> Though both these claims support the theory that the US may have known about a potential terrorist attack, there is not enough evidence within these records that claims that the government knew about the specific attack details surrounding 9/11. Hart, LIHOP conspiracy theorists and those who criticize Bush’s administration under 9/11 benefit over the attempts of legitimizing this fake theory as the entire purpose of this theory is to undermine Bush’s presidency and claim he would profit over being the “hero” of US citizens at the wake of a devastating attack that he allowed.
	</p> 
<p>Hart, and other conspiracy theorists, claim that the CIA and FBI knew and told Bush of an upcoming terrorist attack involving the hijacking of planes at target destinations which include: the Pentagon, the Twin Towers, the White House, Congress and the Statue of Liberty. In fact, this claim contradicts what was revealed in the government commission released on the 9/11 attacks. Peter Bergen reveals in the Britannica that the CIA had no prior knowledge of the plan of the hijackers. However, the CIA were at fault for not <a class="link"  href="https://www.britannica.com/event/September-11-attacks/The-September-11-commission-and-its-findings">adding two suspected terrorists to their watch list and not identifying these terrorists to the FBI.</a> These two terrorists were later found as the hijackers who plunged into the Pentagon. Similar to what was mentioned before, the key issue with the LIHOP theory is the claim that the CIA knew about the 9/11 attacks. In the government commission however, the CIA <a class="link" href="https://www.britannica.com/event/September-11-attacks/The-September-11-commission-and-its-findings">only knew and ignored the warnings of potential terrorist attacks</a>, which did not reveal the plans of 9/11 due to the lack of investigation. </p>
<p>After incidents occur, with proper investigations, it is natural to point out the mistakes in what could have been done to prevent such disasters. However, evidence pointing to mistakes to some does not equal evidence pointing to conspiracies of many. Yet many opt to conspiracy theories as a means to hindsight bias, claiming that they knew something would deliberately happen and that someone/something is to blame for not preventing such. Conspiracy theories should be treated like any other theory: they should be subjected to questioning and rigorous research. When there are alternate explanations that conflict the data, we should collect perspectives and information to come up with our own views, which are subject to change as new information comes to light. </p>
