	<p>The attacks in the United States on September 11, 2001, were organized and orchestrated by the US government. This claim is according to the documentary <em>Loose Change: Final Cut</em>. Through analysis of each plane crash, released government information of the events, photos, videos, and more, director Dylan Avery is persistent that the truth of 9/11 is covered up. But one question stands: why does he think it is a lie?</p>

	<p>The film, more than two hours long, consists of multiple acts and chapters, starting with backgrounds on the nineteen alleged plane hijackers. In this section, he uses known information about the hijackers, like their belongings, and questions their validity. He also brings in secondary sources of people talking about the hijacker's training or personalities to build the connection between the hijackers and the United States government. </p>

	<p>Section two, wargames, is more based on conspiracy and hasty generalization. It discusses government-sponsored training exercises and preparations for a potential airplane crash into the Pentagon. This theory constructs that the government was rehearsing for the events that would occur on 9/11. </p>

	<p>The following three sections all analyze the plane crashes into the Pentagon, the Twin Towers, and Shanksville, respectively, with the next section covering the collapse of building 7. In each chapter, Avery introduces and examines news coverage, videos, pictures, and personal stories. The most notable conspiracies that arose from these analyses were: that the Pentagon was not struck by a plane due to the size of the wreckage, the lack of plane debris, and the absence of videos of the crash; if the Pentagon was struck by a plane, it was controlled by an experienced and highly skilled pilot, not the hijacker who flunked flight school; the twin towers fell due to controlled demolition as shown by blow out videos, eyewitness reports of explosions, and the inability of the two planes to bring down the three buildings; the Shanksville plane crash site was not real; building 7 of the World Trade Center was also destroyed because of controlled demolition.</p>

	<p>Ending on the 9/11 commission and a short epilogue, Avery concludes with a couple of reasons why the United States government was behind 9/11. Some causes are the need to strengthen the defense sector which was accomplished through the Patriot Acts and the creation of the department of homeland security, the growth of the government's control as seen by the Military Act which ended habeas corpus and increased domestic surveillance, and justification for the presidencies actions which included the invasions of Afghanistan and Iraq and the expenses of Bush in office. </p>

	<p>Avery and his team approached 9/11 through the lens of distrust in the United States which would cause them to look for any piece of information that would prove their point, even if it was false. The biggest lie in the documentary was that there were bombs inside the Twin Towers. Avery states the stress on the building's architecture and the large-scale fires caused by the plane crashes were not enough to bring down the towers. His proof includes a blurry video of an explosion-like event from when the centers came down, a correlation to other large buildings which had been on fire and did not fall, and some architects claim that the buildings were prepared for destructive forces. However, the <a class=”link” href=”https://www.nist.gov/world-trade-center-investigation/study-faqs/wtc-towers-investigation”>National Institute of Standards and Technology, NIST, carried out a full formal investigation of the WTC Towers</a> and prove the opposite: “jet-fuel ignited multi-floor fires (which reached temperatures as high as 1,000 degrees Celsius, or 1,800 degrees Fahrenheit) [and] significantly weakened the floors and columns with dislodged fireproofing to the point where floors sagged and pulled inward on the perimeter columns. This led to the inward bowing of the perimeter columns” and the subsequent collapse of the buildings. </p>

	<p>Other blatant fake news includes: the buildings should have fallen asymmetrically and not in free fall (<a class=”link” href=”https://www.tms.org/pubs/journals/jom/0112/eagar/eagar-0112.html”>except it could have</a>); there was molten steel in the debris of the towers (<a class=”link” href=”https://www.nist.gov/world-trade-center-investigation/study-faqs/wtc-towers-investigation”>NIST claims that it was not steel, but aluminum</a>); there was no plane that crashed in Shanksville, Pennsylvania due to the lack of large debris (<a class=”link” href=”https://www.popularmechanics.com/military/a5688/debunking-911-myths-flight-93/”>read this analysis by Popular Mechanics); internal bombs brought down WTC 7 (<a class=”link” href=”https://www.nist.gov/world-trade-center-investigation/study-faqs/wtc-7-investigation”>the NIST has investigated the true reason for its collapse</a>). </p>

	<p>Considerably, not everything the documentary claims are false. For example, some substantial facts that are new to many Americans include the American flight training of many of the hijackers, the presence of many military or government workers on Flight 93, the Environmental Protection Agency hiding the unsafety of the air after 9/11, and more. However, these pieces of information are used to speculate, not support the conspiracies.  </p>

	<p>Taking a look at who was behind the film, we learn why it was created. Dylan Avery, the director, writer, and editor of <em>Loose Change: Final Cut</em>, has a history of producing and directing inherently political and informative documentaries and some comedic shorts from 2005 to the present. He created the first version of <em>Loose Change</em> when he was just 18. Since then, he has not been shy about his distrust of the US government. On his Twitter, Avery is observed posting memes, creative projects, behind-the-scenes of his films, and video game content. </p>

	<p>Avery’s closest workers were producers Korey Rowe and Jason Bermas. Rowe has also produced and edited multiple other documentaries, TV shows, and dramas. Before working on <em>Loose Change: Final Cut</em>, he was a US soldier who served in Afghanistan, Iraq, and Kuwait but was charged with felony desertion. In an <a class=”link” href=”https://www.washingtonpost.com/nation/interactive/2021/loose-change-korey-rowe-911-truth-conspiracy/”>interview by The Washington Post</a>, Rowe has stated his reason for helping with the film was his anger with the US government and the media. “‘I just wanted to say something'” (Del Real, 2021). Bermas has the least experience in documentaries, only a few over the years. However, he is currently a conspiracy theorist content creator on Rokfin and YouTube. His content consists of clickbait, loud commentary, unreliable sources, and overall fake news. </p>

	<p>Trio Avery, Rowe, and Bermas were all young and inexperienced when they created <em>Loose Change: Final Cut</em>. They had no formal training in journalism or filmmaking, just laptops, cameras, and a goal. This film was their way of finding their way in the world. They were unprepared for their efforts to go viral and have such a monumental impact on American culture. </p>

	<p>Alex Jones joined as an executive producer for this version of the documentary. Although, it is not clear how much influence he had on the film besides its funding. Jones presents as a far-right conspiracy theorist who created the radio show <em>The Alex Jones Show</em>, the fake news websites <em>InfoWars</em> and <em>NewsWars</em>, and has directed and produced many other political documentaries, of which at least four relate to 9/11 conspiracies. </p>

	<p>The script consultant for the film was David Ray Griffin, a big name in the 9/11 truth movement. He became skeptical about the real reason for the attacks on 9/11 after reading <em>The Terror Timeline: Year by Year, Day by Day, Minute by Minute: A Comprehensive Chronicle of the Road to 9/11 – and America’s Response</em>. With an education in theology, Griffin has written several books and essays questioning the United States Government and 9/11. </p>

	<p>The creators of this documentary will have some monetary incentive and maybe even pride to try their best to legitimize this story. For many of them, <em>Loose Change: Final Cut</em> kickstarted their careers in filmmaking and producing. Without it, they would not have as successful careers and no reason to keep creating such content. Benefits will not just be in American hands, but in foreign ones too. Other nations will benefit from this story because this documentary creates distrust for US citizens in the US government. It also creates a social and political divide over the story of 9/11, something that continues to shape America 20 years later. Other nations will see this weakness in the US building and could use it as a time to attack or push for even more imbalance and conspiracy.</p>

	<p><em>Loose Change: Final Cut</em> was one of the largest and most developed conspiracies about 9/11. It led to an increase in skepticism about the truth provided by the US government as the film was an online blockbuster reaching millions of people. Being so mainstream, many people take this as a reliable source to build their own conspiracies and fake news stories about 9/11, especially within the 9/11 Truth Movement. Avery has produced multiple other fake news stories resulting from this first one. Although impossible to track how many books and articles were filled with even more conspiracies and incorrect reporting, there was a clear rise in the movement and false content after the documentary was released. </p>
  
	<p>One clear thing about this documentary is that people are prepared to go to extreme lengths to find the answers they are looking for. Even if they have to attack the trust people have in their own government by creating fake news that fuels a movement no one will forget, their efforts will be revolutionary. To them, the questions still stand: What really happened on September 11th, 2001?</p>
