<p>The collapse of the Twin Towers was one of the most tragic and devastating events to take place in our time. Many have debated what really caused the buildings to collapse in such a free-fall manner, but the leading theory is that the heat from the jet fuel was far too much for the buildings to withstand. </p>

<p>While this is largely believed, others have come out with different variations or disputed the government’s official theories and claims. The Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) proposed that it wasn’t the initial crash of the planes into the buildings that caused the fall because World Trade Centers (WTC) 1 and 2 stood for 1 hour and 43 minutes and 56 minutes respectively. It was the ever growing fires that coupled with the impact of the crash that ultimately caused the collapse of both buildings. </p>

<p>Pressure from groups such as the Architects and Engineers of 9/11 (AE911) challenged the government’s initial theory and led for the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) to conduct their own investigation which would ultimately succeed FEMA’s. NIST’s investigation proposed three hypothesis for the collapse of the buildings: FEMA’s “pancake theory” which suggested that the fire caused the floor trusses to give way and collapse on top of one another, a direct fire-induced column failure, and that the floor connections were study and instead pulled on the floor-to-wall connections and caused it to sag and cave in.</p> 

<p>Like with the collapse of WTC 7, NIST came out with the “Probable Collapse Sequence” that described the collapse in six steps: Structural Damage from Airplane Ampact, Redistribution of Loads, Dislodging of Fireproofing, Sagging of Thermally Weakened Floors Pulled Columns Inward, Exterior Columns Buckling, culminating in Global Collapse. The AE911 group challenged this, claiming that fireproofing dislodgement wasn’t a probable cause because the collapse started on the 98th floor, but NIST didn’t find any dislogment on the 98th or 99th floor.</p> 

<p>During a computer modeling of what should've been a replica of the collapse, AE911 notes that the modeling actually disproved their theory because NIST had to significantly manipulate the collapse with “unsupported facts.” Moreover, the fires in the modeling lasted longer than they did during the attack where NIST claimed that it sagged.</p> 

<p>There is some truth to NIST’S investigation such as the trusses did in fact tug on the floor to column ones and it did sag, but it wasn’t primarily caused by the fire. The so called “free-falling” of the buildings also varies as it depends on the angle in which a video was taken in and the overall perspective, while it may look free-falling for one person it may not for another.</p>

<p>Certainly, those who oppose and distrust the government are the disseminators for this story and virtually most conspiracy theories relating to 9/11 which makes readers that much more confused as these conspiracies seem to have evidence to debunk a lot of what the government tells us. This is seen with how AE911’s overall website and “Official Theory” has a clear layout and references for their evidence. Additionally, victims of the attack themselves can be hurt with these different theories because people place more importance on disproving the government than remembering those who were lost.</p>
